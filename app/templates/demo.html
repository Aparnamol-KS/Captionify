    <div><p>So today we're going to start by revisiting the concept of quadratic equations, which we've already seen in earlier classes. Remember, a standard quadratic equation takes the form a \(x^2\) plus b \(x\) plus c equals zero, where a, b, and c are real numbers and a is not equal to zero. Now, the most common method we use to solve this is the quadratic formula, which is given by \(x\) equals negative b plus or minus the square root of \(b^2\) minus four \(ac\), all divided by two \(a\). As I mentioned before, this formula comes from completing the square, and it's useful in almost every case. Also, keep in mind that the expression under the square root, which is \(b^2\) minus four \(ac\), is called the discriminant, and it tells us about the nature of the roots. If it's positive, we get two real and distinct solutions. If it's zero, the roots are real and equal. And if it's negative, the equation has two complex roots. Alright, now shifting gears a bit, let's talk briefly about distance in two-dimensional space. Suppose we have two points, say \(x_1\), \(y_1\) and \(x_2\), \(y_2\) â€“ the distance between them is given by the formula \(\sqrt{(x_2-x_1)^2 + (y_2-y_1)^2}\). That's basically the Pythagorean theorem applied in coordinate geometry. We use this often when analyzing geometric shapes or modeling physical systems. Okay, before we move on, just quickly jot that down and let me know if you need a recap on any of those formulas.</p>
